              Rabindranath Tagore, born on May 7, 1861, in Kolkata, India, and
              passing away on August 7, <br>1941, was a multifaceted talent. Hailing
              from Bengal, he was a poet, short-story writer, music <br>composer,
              playwright, novelist, and painter. His innovative approach

                introduced fresh prose and verse styles along with colloquial
                language, liberating Bengali <br>literature from the confines of
                classical Sanskrit norms. Notably, he bridged the gap between <br>
                Indian and Western cultures, enriching both sides through his
                contributions.

              Swami Vivekananda's inspiring personality was well known both in
              India and in America during <br> the last decade of the nineteenth

                The unknown monk of India suddenly leapt into fame at the
                Parliament of Religions held in <br> Chicago in 1893, at which he
                represented Hinduism. His vast knowledge of Eastern and Western <br>
                culture as well as his deep spiritual insight, fervid eloquence,
                brilliant conversation, broad human <br>sympathy, colourful
                personality, and handsome figure made an irresistible appeal to
                the many <br>types of Americans who came in contact with him. People
                who saw or heard Vivekananda even <br>once still cherish his memory
                after a lapse of more than half a century.
